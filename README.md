#  Exposure to extreme temperatures during pregnancy and birth weight: evidence from Chile (2011 – 2020)

--LINK VIDEO--

**Background**: Exposure to extreme temperatures, both high and low, during pregnancy can have adverse effects on fetal development, with birth weight being a critical indicator of neonatal health, however, there is little evidence from Latin America.

**Objective**: Evaluate the association between exposure to ambient temperatures during pregnancy, birth weight (grams, g) in full-term infants (gestational age ≥ 37 weeks).

**Methods:** We conducted a population-based cohort design using secondary information from birth records between 2011 and 2020. Mean, minimum, and maximum daily temperatures were obtained from government monitors in 26 municipalities representing different climatic zones of Chile. Percentiles were calculated for each climatic zone and assigned for the entire pregnancy, trimester, and gestational week based on residence, date of birth and gestational age. General additive models (GAM) and distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM) were used, using the 50th percentile for comparison. All models adjusted for month and year of last menstrual cycle and maternal and paternal: age, education level, and employment status.
